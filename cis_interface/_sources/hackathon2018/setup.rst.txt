Installation
############


First Steps with Windows
========================

If you are running Windows, you will first need to install Microsoft 
Visual Studio. If you do not already have a copy, the free community 
edition will work and can be downloaded 
`here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/express/>`_. Visual Studio (VS)
can be installed in parallel with conda, just be sure to finish installing 
VS before moving on to installing |cis_interface|.


Setting up your Conda environment
=================================

For the purpose of the hackathon, we recommend using a conda environment
with Python 3.6 installed. Conda allows you to have multile development 
environments with different versions of Python and/or software packages 
on the same machine. While this is not strictly necessary, it is recommended
as it will help to ensure that you are using the same version of 
|cis_interface| and its dependencies as everyone else.

If you do not already have conda on your machine, download and 
install Anaconda from `here <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_.

Once Anaconda (or Miniconda) is installed you can create a new Python 3.6 
environment for the hackathon by entering the following at your terminal 
prompt (or Anaconda prompt for Windows)::

  $ conda create -n cis python=3.6

On Linux/MacOS, the created environment can be activated by calling::

  $ source activate cis

On Windows, this can be done by calling the following from the Anaconda 
prompt::

  $ activate cis

Verify that the correct version of Python is now being used.::

  $ python --version


Installing |cis_interface|
==========================

Directions for installing the |cis_interface| package and its dependencies 
can be found :ref:`here <install_rst>`. We recommend installing via 
conda and/or pip for the purpose of the hackathon.


Get Hackathon Materials
=======================

To get started, we will walk through transforming an example model and 
connecting it to other models. To make sure we are all on the same page, 
create a ``cis_home`` directory somewhere that you will remember and can 
access from the command line and then move into that directory::

  $ mkdir cis_home
  $ cd cis_home

The tutorial will use this directory as a reference for naming files and 
running the examples.

The materials for the hackathon tutorials are 
in a git repository on GitHub called 
`hackathon2018 <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/hackathon2018>`_.

Using Git
---------

If you have a GitHub account, are familiar with git, and would like to 
save changes you make to the hackathon materials for future reference, 
you can fork the hackathon2018 repository (Fork button in the upper right) 

.. image:: setup_images/setup_fork.png

and clone your fork on your machine into the ``cis_home`` directory.::

  $ git clone https://github.com/[your username]/hackathon2018.git


Via Download
------------

If you don't have a GitHub account or don't know git, you can download the 
repository as a .zip or .tar.gz archive from the GitHub page by clicking 
`Download ZIP` in the box that drops down when you click the green 
`Clone or Download` button.

You can also download a tagged version of the materials from 
`here <https://github.com/cropsinsilico/hackathon2018/releases/tag/1.0>`_.

Once downloaded, extract the repository into the ``cis_home`` directory.


Running Tests
-------------

From the ``hackathon2018`` directory, run the tests to ensure that everything 
is working::

  $ cd hackathon2018
  $ ./run_tests.sh

The tests script will display output from some of the models we will be using. 
If you have any errors, please let us know so we can track down any issues you 
might be having. Warnings are OK.
